# ortho_tetris

An ortholinear 75% monstrosity that I thoroughly regret building.  No, not really.  But it was completely unusable for me.

* Keyboard Maintainer: [ymlmkb](https://github.com/ymlmkb)
* Hardware Supported: Postage Board
* Hardware Availability: NA

Make example for this keyboard (after setting up your build environment):

    make handwired/ortho_tetris:ymlmkb

See [build environment setup](https://docs.qmk.fm/#/getting_started_build_tools) then the [make instructions](https://docs.qmk.fm/#/getting_started_make_guide) for more information.
